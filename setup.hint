sdesc: "XML output extension to GCC"
ldesc: "The purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML 
description of a C++ program from GCC's internal representation. Since 
XML is easy to parse, other development tools will be able to work with 
C++ programs without the burden of a complicated C++ parser."
